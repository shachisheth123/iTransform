You want to hide implementation details behind a public programming interface. By interface,we mean the set of accessible methods your code makes available for other code to call?in other words, your code's API. By hiding implementation details, you can rework your method code (perhaps also altering the way variables are used by your class) without forcing a change in the code that calls your changed method. If you want maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility (and of course, you do),your design must include encapsulation. How do you do that?? Keep instance variables protected (with an access modifier, often private).? Make public accessor methods, and force calling code to use those methods rather than directly accessing the instance variable.? For the methods, use the JavaBeans naming convention of set<someProperty> and get<someProperty>"

It's safe to say that it's almost (almost?) impossible to write even the tiniest Java program without using inheritance.In OO, the concept of IS-A is based on class inheritance or interface implementation. IS-A is a way of saying, this thing is a type of that thing. For example, a Mustang is a type of horse, so in OO terms we can say, Mustang IS-A Horse. Subaru IS-A Car. Broccoli IS-A Vegetable (not a very fun one, but it still counts). You express the IS-A relationship in Java through the keywords extends (for class inheritance) and implements (for interface implementation)."

A reference is a variable, so it can be reassigned to other objects, (unless the reference is declared final).? A reference variable's type determines the methods that can be invoked on the object the variable is referencing.? A reference variable can refer to any object of the same type as the declared reference, or?this is the big one?it can refer to any subtype of the declared type!? A reference variable can be declared as a class type or an interface type. If the variable is declared as an interface type, it can reference any object of any class that implements the interface."
